# RevatureProject1
This is a project which is created in hive. 
The project was to create and maintain a database for candidate enrollment  where they provide training for various courses . 
We have created two tables in MySQL and import then to HDFS using SQOOP.
In this project we have created night tables from the two datasets. 
We have performed various operations in this project like table join , partitioning, updation etc. We have also performed queries in tables where we have extracted the data from it.
